- **Git** for version control
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nisanth-2025/DSA.git
cd DSA
```

### 2. Navigate to Problem Categories

```bash
cd "Logic Building/Easy"    # For easy problems
cd "Logic Building/Medium"  # For medium problems  
cd "Logic Building/Hard"    # For hard problems
```

### 3. Compile and Run Java Programs

```bash
# Compile a Java file
javac ProblemName.java

# Run the compiled program
java ProblemName
```

## 📝 Problem Categories

| Category | Description | Count |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Easy** | Basic algorithms and simple logic | Coming Soon |
| **Medium** | Intermediate complexity problems | Coming Soon |
| **Hard** | Advanced algorithms and optimization | Coming Soon |
